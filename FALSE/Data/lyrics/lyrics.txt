[Brian:]
Close your eyes, make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

[Brian and All:]
No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

[Brian:]
Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside (oh yeah)
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

[Brian and All:]
No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss (ohh)
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

[Howie:]
It's an illusion

[Howie and Kevin:]
How can I feel this way?

[AJ and Kevin:]
If I can't have you

[Howie:]
It's an illusion

[Howie and Kevin:]
Nothing is real this way

[AJ and Kevin:]
If I can't have you

[Brian and All (Nick):]
No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now (now)
Caught by the taste of your kiss (I don't wanna know)
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this (I'm climbing the walls)
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss

[AJ and Nick:]
You

[Brian:]
Ohhhh
I can't let you go no

[All:]
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this (ohh ohh)
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss (I miss) you

1,../lyrics/westlife/howtobreakaheart.html,Westlife Lyrics,How To Break A Heart,"

Since you're not worth my love
I haven't given up
I'm stronger than that
(I'm stronger than that)
And though my heart will break
I'm takin' back my faith
Cos right now my world is spinnin' too fast
But you won't be the end of me
If you were the one you wouldn't hurt me so bad
You gave me the world

Gave me the world to take it all away
All you left me was yesterday
And this space in my heart
Now it's slowly tearin' me apart
I'm takin' all that I learned from you
I'll make it something I'll never do
I can't be who you are
You taught me how to break a heart
You taught me how to break a heart

I'll make it through this pain
My dreams won't call your name
I'm stronger than that
(I'm stronger than that)
Cos I still know how to love
Know that will be enough
And this moment will fade into the past
You won't be the end of me
If you were the one you wouldn't hurt me so bad
You gave me the world

Gave me the world to take it all away
All you left me was yesterday
And this space in my heart
Now it's slowly tearing me apart
I'm takin' all that I learned from you
I'll make it something I'll never do
I can't be who you are
You taught me how to break a heart
You taught me how to break a heart

I'm takin' all that I learned from you
I'll make it something I'll never do
I can't be who you are
You taught me how to break a heart
You taught me how to break a heart

I'm taking back my faith
I'm taking back my life
I don't care for who you are
Cos you taught me how to break a heart
How to break a heart
How to break a heart
Cos you taught me how to break a heart

2,../lyrics/deanmartin/iwill.html,Dean Martin Lyrics,I Will,"

I don't want to be the one to say I'm gonna miss you but I will
I don't want to say I'm gonna cry my eyes out baby but I will
I'm not ashamed for you to know how much I really love you so
Cuz it was such a thrill
And just remember when you're gone there'll be that someone sad who loves you still

You will look at him and see me smiling back at you
I know you will (You will)
And you will find yourself repeating things we used to do
I know you will (You will)

Don't wonder if you want to come back just come running home to me
And let me feel that thrill
Cuz I'm the one who told you
I would love you dear forever and I will

Oh, I will...
Yes, I will...

Don't wonder if you want to come back just come running home to me
And let me feel that thrill
Cuz I'm the one who told you
I would love you dear forever and I will
Cuz I'm the one who told you
I would love you dear forever and I will
(I will)

Sure I loved the dear money that shines in her hair
And the brow that's all furrowed and wrinkled with care
I kissed the dear fingers that hold all that dough
Oh God bless her and  keep her
Tell your mother hello

Be honest with me dear whatever you do
Remember you're mine dear so always be true
Where ever you wander on land or on sea
If you really love me be honest with me

My poor heart would break dear if you were untrue
Asleep or awake dear I dream about you
Oh you are my darling you're all that I see
If you really love me be honest with me

Some day I'll return dear kinda make you my own
And how I will yearn dear when I'm all alone
But I never forget dear your sweet memory
If you really love me be honest with me

5,../lyrics/deanmartin/myriflemyponyandme.html,Dean Martin Lyrics,"My Rifle, My Pony And Me","

The sun is sinking in the west
The cattle go down to the stream
The redwing settles in the nest
It's time for a cowboy to dream

Purple light in the canyons
That's where I long to be
With my three good companions
Just my rifle, pony and me

Gonna hang (gonna hang) my sombrero (my sombrero)
On the limb (on the limb) of a tree (of a tree)
Coming home (coming home) sweetheart darling (sweetheart darling)
Just my rifle, pony and me
Just my rifle, my pony and me

(Whippoorwill in the willow
Sings a sweet melody
Riding to Amarillo)
Just my rifle, pony and me
No more cows (no more cows) to be roping (to be roping)
No more strays will I see
Round the bend (round the bend) she'll be waiting (she'll be waiting)
For my rifle, pony and me
For my rifle, my pony and me

6,../lyrics/westlife/changeyourmind.html,Westlife Lyrics,Change Your Mind,"

Hey, girl, it's all over town 
So how come I'm the last to find out 
That you're leaving, with some other guy 
Help me understand, why oh why 

Tell, me, what he does for you 
Is there something that I didn't do 
All those late nights, I left you alone 
I was working on our happy home 

And then I come to find out 
That you're about to walk out 

[Chorus:]
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time 
I know he said he loves you more than I 
That's a lie 
Let me change your mind 
Oooh...
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake 
Stop before you turn and walk away 
Give me time 
Let me change your mind 
Oooh... Oooh... Oooh... Oooh... 

I, know, if you ever leave 
Baby someday, you'll look back and see 
That it's right here, that you should've been 
But you can run back to me 

And don't make me look for someone new 
When all I wanted is you 

[Chorus:]
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time 
I know he said he loves you more than I 
That's a lie 
Let me change your mind 
Oooh... 
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake 
Stop before you turn and walk away 
Give me time 
Let me change your mind 
Oooh... Oooh... Oooh... Oooh... 

Don't make me look for someone new 
When all I wanted is you 

[Chorus:]
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time 
I know he said he loves you more than I 
That's a lie 
Let me change your mind 
Oooh... 
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake 
Stop before you turn and walk away 
Give me time 
Let me change your mind 
Oooh... Oooh... Oooh... Oooh...

7,../lyrics/deanmartin/togetheragain.html,Dean Martin Lyrics,Together Again,"

Together again my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights are now at an end
The key to my heart you hold in your hand
And nothing else matters we're together again.

(Nothing else matters we're together again.)

Together again the grey skies are gone
You're back in my arms now where you belong
The love that I knew is living again
And nothing else matters we're together again.

And nothing else matters we're together again.
(Together again...)

8,../lyrics/westlife/fragileheart.html,Westlife Lyrics,Fragile Heart,"

A fragile heart was broken before
I don't think it could endure another pain
But there's a voice from deep inside of you
That's calling out to make you realize

That this new bond gives inspiration
To all who feel no love appeal no more
So how can I break this wall around you
That's aiding both our hearts to grow in pain

So forget your past, and we can dream tomorrow
Save our hearts for care and loving too
It's hard, I know,
But oh, one thing's for sure
Don't go and break this fragile heart

A hurting mind in need of emotion
I don't think it could endure another pain
But baby in you I've found affection,
Affection I have never felt before.

So don't let your past destroy what comes tomorrow
Don't go and break this fragile heart

With all this fire that burns between us
There's so much to lose, yet so much more to gain
And if I could choose the world around me
The world I'd choose would all revolve around you
So help me complete the game inside me
And help to mend, to mend this fragile heart

9,../lyrics/backstreetboys/everytimeiclosemyeyes.html,Backstreet Boys Lyrics,Everytime I Close My Eyes,"

Everytime I close my eyes
Everytime I close my eyes

Listen girl I don't know where to start
But every word I say comes straight from the heart
I've been so wrong
I never meant to hurt you
Oh girl, I'm sorry
For what I put you through
Girl I'd do anything
For one more chance (one more chance)
Cuz I want you back again (want you back)

[Chorus:]
Cuz everytime I close my eyes
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me?
Now I realize
I want you girl and no other
Everytime I close my eyes
You're all that I see

You and I shared a life together
Each other, was all we'd ever need (all we'd ever need)
I thought you would stay with me forever
But I took for granted
The love you gave to me
I keep on tryin' (keep on tryin')
'Til the end ('til the end)
Baby I need you back with me again (I need you back)

[Chorus]

And girl I'm goin' out of my mind
I miss you so much
I don't know what to do (what to do)
Please say it's just a matter of time
Until I feel your touch
Until you let me come back to you I'm in love with you

I think about you girl everynight
I'm in love and it feels so right
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain
I was just caught up in that lying game
But now those days are over
I've changed my ways
And now I'm countin' the minutes
I'm countin' the days
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start
To find a new way to get back into your heart

Girl I'd do anything for one more chance (one more chance)
Cuz I want you
I want you back again (I want you back)

[Chorus]
